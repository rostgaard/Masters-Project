\chapter{Design}
This chapter is contains a discussion on the design of the different aspects of the requirement-to-test methodology. This discussion is started on the conceptual level with the aspects and interests of the different stakeholders.

\section{Overview}
Given the high rate of software project failures, and the general widespread requirement/implementation mismatch, it would be safe to claim that requirements (and use cases) are incomplete with regards to system working. However, during the development life-cycle, additional domain knowledge is bound be acquired. This knowledge improves then general understanding of the problem domain, towards a better solutions. But it and may also affect the the requirements by making them more elaborate, complete, correct -- or event invalidate them. In any case, software development is an ongoing process, and use cases, and requirements must be, in a strict definition, expected to be incomplete, inaccurate and part of the development process.\\\\
Integrating requirements deeper into the development can be -- and is -- done by adding a reference system from documentation to implementation files or components. This way, automated system can send out reminders to developers on which documents should be review, whenever a change has happened in a component.
Documentation, however, is usually written in natural language, with all the befits and ambiguities that follows. Also, reformulating documentation may cause a feed back loop back into the implementation, which then needs to be reviewed and -- perhaps -- changed.\\\\
If there existed a method for validating the refined requirements

\subsection{Costumer perspective}
% What is to be gained for this stakeholder?
The problem in attaining broad coverage of use cases, and therefore completeness in requirements i primarily that, from the customer perspective, that they feel very overly-verbose and usually too formal in nature. For software engineers, the opposite is usually the case. They feel that the use case descriptions are not structured nor elaborate enough for use in, for instance, code stub generation.

More structure, however, could be helped along the way with proper tooling. Hiding some of the complexity of the constrains of a data model behind a simple user interface supplying dragable components and providing immediate visual feedback in the form of textual use case representation (or a diagram) could "cheat" the customer into adding the needed structure to the use case model.

\label{fig:use_case_creation_activity_diagram}
\end{figure}

What is in the customers interest is having acceptance tests match the use cases as closely as possible. Preferably, the should be able to be automated as well. Figure \ref{fig:use_case_creation_activity_diagram} shows an activity diagram involving three actors, the customer, the engineer and the system\footnote{Use case system}. In this diagram, the customer authors use cases while adding missing definitions not already in the tool. A definition is textual description of a concept which may be -- for instance -- an actor, role or action. This description is then given a unique name, that may correspond to a concept already found in the domain model. The domain model, if defined beforehand, could also be thought to be a part of the built-in declarations.

\label{fig:use_case_editor_mockup}
\end{figure}

Whenever there is a new use case, a change to an existing use case, or simply a definition, the system should try to generate tests from the new information. If this step fails it is likely due to insufficient concept mappings. From here, a software engineer must manually map individual definitions to system macro-functionality or, possibly the use case could be linked to an existing manually written test, if the generation step is not possible for some reason. A mockup of a user interface from the customer point of view is shown in figure \ref{fig:use_case_editor_mockup}. A list of available actors (only containing one element, however) is shown on the right hand side. The main part of the window contains the use case currently being worked on. The bottom part of the window is the edit part, where dropdown lists of actions and targets resides.

Some basics on the procedure; take every line of the use case and not every concept and actor used. Then speculate on the realization of this. Which components should be involved, and which other actors. Depending on the concrete architecture, these components may be services, larger program components (such as Java packages), or even sub-functions.

\section{Outline}
Given that we want to be able to generate tests based on requirements require structure and a touch of semantics. For the latter, we need to infer some minimal understanding into the test generation system of what the different components are (actor, action, \dots). For the structure part, we must enforce some sort of categorization such as defining the level, scope and composition of a use case. By composition is meant the different parts; scenario, pre- and post-conditions.\\
This structure and semantics are best defined by the stakeholder that knowns the problem domain by heart; the customer of the software. There are however some challenges in extracting the domain knowledge from these stakeholders which is discussed in the next section.

\section{Stakeholders}

% What is to be gained for this stakeholder?
There are different levels to write the use-case tests on;
%\begin{description}
%  \item [Manually:] all the tests and the domain model and logic
%  \item [Partially automatic:] either by writing up support code for the domain model manually, and generates the use cases, or the other way around.
%  \item [Fully:] automatic.

\section{Proposed solution}
"Side-cart" tool that (maybe) uses natural language processing. The developement is supported by a two-sided approach. Both top-down and bottom-up. Meaning that design an implementation will go hand-in-hand and hopefully lead to a good middle-road.
%TODO something about existing approaches.
%TODO Step-wise go through the enhancement process.

\section{Brainstorming}
The problem in attaining broad coverage of use cases, and therefore completeness in requirements i primarily that, from the customer perspective, that they feel very overly-verbose and usually too formal in nature. For software engineers, the opposite is usually the case. They feel that the use case descriptions are not structured nor elaborate enough for use in, for instance, code stub generation.

More structure, however, could be helped along the way with proper tooling. Hiding some of the complexity of the constrains of a data model behind a simple user interface supplying dragable components and providing immediate visual feedback in the form of textual use case representation (or a diagram) could "cheat" the customer into adding the needed structure to the use case model.

What is in the customers interest is having acceptance tests match the use cases as closely as possible. Preferably, the should be able to be automated as well. Figure \ref{fig:use_case_creation_activity_diagram} shows an activity diagram involving three actors, the customer, the engineer and the system\footnote{Use case system}. In this diagram, the customer authors use cases while adding missing definitions not already in the tool. A definition is textual description of a concept which may be -- for instance -- an actor, role or action. This description is then given a unique name, that may correspond to a concept already found in the domain model. The domain model, if defined beforehand, could also be thought to be a part of the built-in declarations.

\end{figure}

Whenever there is a new use case, a change to an existing use case, or simply a definition, the system should try to generate tests from the new information. If this step fails it is likely due to insufficient concept mappings. From here, a software engineer must manually map individual definitions to system macro-functionality or, possibly the use case could be linked to an existing manually written test, if the generation step is not possible for some reason. A mockup of a user interface is shown in figure \ref{fig:use_case_editor_mockup}.

% Something about generating partially-automated tests, where the system sets up everything for the customer and then notifies them about the next steps they have to take to move the test forward.

\section{Extracting semantic}
Example; in the use case it is stated that a call is hung up and a callee awaits this event. The lifeline of the call is however not tracked and to be able to properly assert the true state of this, the code macro needs to into account this lifeline and reflect on which assertions hold for every stakeholder that has knowledge of the call. % TODO: Elaborate the example and explain that a phone call is a good example because it has an A and B-leg and potentially a system that tracks its state.

\subsection{Letting the customer inject semantics}

There are two basic approaches to letting the customer inject semantics into the requirements. The first is to do a full up-front declaration of every term used within the problem domain and supply this as a toolbox for the customer %todo example.
The other approach is to do it on the go by outlining concepts as stubs whenever they appear. This approach is similar to what is used in wiki software. %todo eaxmple

\section{Verification problem}
A big issue in software

\section{End-user experience}
%The challenge in documenting requirements is, and has always been, to formulate them on a non-ambiguous form. The quantification of ambiguity tends to be difficult as well, due to the fact that requirements are usually formulated in natural languages following some rules, such as pre-defined glossary and constraints. Constraints vocabulary typically consists of should, could, may, must.

%As requirements are basically constraints to your system, a subset of them may be expressed as expressions following a formality that is machine-interpretable. Vienna Development Method (VDM) and Z notation are two approaches that tries to formally describe systems on a very high level, so that model-checking can be performed on it prior to programming.

An example UI is Starting from scratch, the user would be expected to initially define at least one actor and add a sequence of actions that the actor perform.

Avoid technical jargon (\cite{christel1992issues})

\section{Use case writing level}
\subsection{What to include?}
From \cite{Cockburn:2000:WEU:517669} we get;
\begin{quote}
``... The use case, as the contract for behavior, captures \emph{all and only} the behaviors related to satisfy the stakeholders’ interests.''
\end{quote}
Should not be used to describe UI actions% http://alistair.cockburn.us/Use+cases%2c+ten+years+later (Use case limits).

Use cases expresses expected system behavior. Keep use cases free of UI-action.

There are several levels on which use cases can be written as per\cite{cockburn??}. In our case, it would make the most sense to use the "system" level, as business level is something that is nearly useless because it is largely out of scope. The business logic is also, more elaborately (and implicitly) formulated within a system-level use case. In the other end, a component use case is also very impractical, as our target audience would be people that does not know anything about the specifics of the system being built.

%Note;
An important aspect to keep in mind is that context is important. Writing hundreds of pages of detailed requirements are bound to be decoupled and lose context, and coherence with each other. Deciding on a level that keeps context is important.

\section{Expressing requirements}
%Requirement gathering and documentation often feels a lot like stating the obvious, and being overly-verbose.

\section{Use case translation}
\input{chapters/ast_use_case}

\section{Targeted requirements}
We've chosen to focus on the requirements that involves core features from the Receptionist actor point of view. These are, on a high level;
\begin{description}
  \item[Manage calls:] Being able to technically handle calls by performing receive, park, transfer and hangup action.
  \item[Process calls:] Being able to process calls in the context of a dialed reception. This involves having access to data about the reception and its contacts. Being able to dial them, or send them a message.
  \item[Manage message:] Being able to send out messages to contacts, view and resend existing messages.
\end{description}

For our targeted use cases, we've cherry-picked some specific paths from the activity diagram for the receptionist actor (see figure \ref{fig:activity_diagram_receptionist}).

\begin{description}
  \item[UC1: Transfer to contact:] A receptionist must be able to transfer a call to a chosen contact associated with the currently active reception. An example use case, from the receptionist actor point of view is outlined below.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Preconditions.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Receptionist is handling picked up incoming call $A$
      \item Receptionist has parked call $A$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Actions.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Receptionist dials the number of the selected contact (call $B$)
      \item Receptionist hears dial tone
      \item The contact's phone is ringing.
      \item The contact accepts the calls (picks up)
      \item Receptionist has a dialogue with contact
      \item Receptionist transfers call $B$ to call $A$
      \item The system breaks the receptionist's connection to both call $A$ and $B$    
      \item Receptionist marks his/her state as idle.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \item[UC2: Send message to contact:] A receptionist must be able to send a message -- via a distribution list -- to a contact, typically containing information received verbally via a call. An example use case, from the receptionist actor point of view is outlined below.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Preconditions.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Receptionist may have previously received a call $A$, which may still be active.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Actions.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Receptionist finds contact $C$ who will serve as recipient
      \item Receptionist selects $C$
      \item Receptionist types in message
      \item Receptionist sends the message via the system
      \item Receptionist marks his/her state as idle.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\section{Structuring use cases}
In order to help the computer make more sense of our use cases, we need to define to it what a use case is. But since a use case is neither strictly defined nor standardized anywhere, we need to pick a suitable representation.
To help us extract some machine-understandable structure -- or merely semantics -- of use cases, we assume that we are working on ideal, well-formed use cases. This abstracts some of away the informal ambiguity, which is notoriously omnipresent in requirements, and will aid us when we try to derive what is needed from use cases in order to generate executable tests from them.\\\\
The first problem we need to solve is the level of use case writing, and template -- as there are many way of writing use cases. 
%TODO More discussion.
We have decided on using a fully-dressed use case template\cite{larman2005applying} as a guideline for the basic structure of the use case. In this, we have some key concepts that we need to address in our translation model. The main focus are concepts which provide useful information to generate tests from.

\section{Use case concepts}
This section discussed the individual components of a use case in the perspective of converting it into an executable test. But before venturing forth, we need to outline the concept of \emph{system state}, as it is referred in the following sections.

\subsection{System state}
Well-formed use cases  know are completely self-contained\cite{larman2005} in the way that every action and alternative, for a given actor, may be put into a single (large) use case. Use cases may also specify some expectations to the system state. This is what is defined as preconditions. If we, however, maintain the system state analogy, we can regard use case executions as mutation functions that affect the global system state.\\\\
A simple example; a actor \emph{accountant} has a use case \emph{accountant creates invoice}. This use case requires that the \emph{accountant} actor has previously been created. The creation could be provided by the \emph{admin} actor's \emph{admin creates accountant} use case.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{\imgdir system-state-machine-relations}
\centering
\caption{State machine of perceived system state}
\label{fig:system-state-machine-relations}
\end{figure}
In summary, the \emph{accountant creates invoice} effectively has a precondition that is provided by \emph{admin creates accountant} to make the global state match what is expected to execute the \emph{accountant creates invoice}. The concept is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:system-state-machine-relations} where \emph{Use Case 1} is a prerequisite to \emph{Use Case 2}, but \emph{Use Case 3} has no prerequisites. In order to reach completion (termination) and coverage of \emph{Use Case 2}, \emph{Use Case 1} has to be executed.\\
Each use case state (an example is \textbf{UC1} in figure \ref{fig:system-state-machine-relations}) is a super-state that contains the state space of every alternative scenario. An example is shown in figure \ref{fig:system-sub-state-machine-relations}, where \\dots %TODO
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\caption{Example sub-states of a use case}
\label{fig:system-sub-state-machine-relations}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Primary actor}
The primary actor is important, as this is the stakeholder that defines the perspective and scope of the test. The primary is the person that starts the use case via an active action, or receives a start signal from another actor -- the system for instance.

\subsection{Preconditions}

To achieve the minimum implementation, we cut away the optional precondition that may be covered by other use cases. After this, we see an implicitly \emph{ordered list of actions} that we need to succeed in order for the test to be a success. There is an actor that performs an action at each step. The system, in its entirety, may also be referred to as an actor as it is also capable of performing actions.

So, summing up, we have;
\begin{itemize}
  \item This use case consists of an ordered list of actions, where actions consist of
  \begin{itemize}
	\item One or more actors
	\item One verb describing the action
	\item One target for the action (object for verb)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
If we 

%The communication model needs to be known.

\subsection{High-level goals}
\todo{.\\Content}

\section{Executable use case}
This section discusses a programming model and possible system designs that supports executing use cases.

\subsection{Environment}
\textbf{!Unfinished!}\\
Executing the use case can be considered a long function call-chain. Each new function call passes along the current global state onto the next procedure. This method of passing along the state is a common pattern is interpreters and compilers, where the global state is referred to as "the environment". In our test-case compiler we adopt this approach. One of the large benefits is to have the ability to have an exit procedure that performs state clean upon exit of every use case. These procedures should run regardless of exceptions raised within the call-chain, but respond to them. This behavior is identical to the functionality seen in "teardown" functions in test framework for programming languages. See section \ref{sec:test_framework_programming} for a discussion on these frameworks.\\\\
The environment should contain the current state within the scope of test currently running. By state is meant any objects created or modified during the test.
The expression of a use case that consists of $n$ statements then becomes: 
\begin{equation}
Postcondition \rightarrow S_n \rightarrow S_{n-1} \rightarrow \dotsb \rightarrow S_2 \rightarrow S_1 \rightarrow Precondition \rightarrow env
\end{equation}
The expression function is applied to the statement, then the result is applied to the matcher which then returns a success or failure value depending on the outcome of the evaluation.
%\texttt{matcher expression} ($s$)

%\begin{algorithmic}
%\If {$i\geq maxval$}
%    \State $i\gets 0$
%\Else
%    \If {$i+k\leq maxval$}
%        \State $i\gets i+k$
%    \EndIf
%\EndIf
%\end{algorithmic}

\subsection{Mapping entries}
Any use case statement may be mapped to an assumption, an error or an assumption.

\subsection{Mapping branches}
Use cases may branch out and go to alternatives actions. These branches are associated with errors, and may be difficult to emulate. One possibility is to use an assumption mapping here, and treat the event or decision as having occurred. For active decisions taken by the primary actor, for example an action taken to better serve a customer request, it is easy to assume. Injecting errors in a running system is something else entirely... %TODO Finish.

\subsection{Determining paths}
%This is, most definitely a non-trivial problem.
In order to find all possible paths in a use case, the easiest way is to represent it as a graph and use a depth-first search or the more efficient one based upon Warshall's Theorem\cite{rubin1978enumerating} to emumerate them. Once a list of paths is retrieved, it is possible to convert every path, which is essentially a list of active actions either performed by, or affecting, the primary actor.\\\\
This list will be translated into a test by converting it into code snibblet, and join them together in a code block that becomes the body of a test function.

Back edges can occur, and this raised the bar, as it introduces loops.

%The basic rules for path collection is;

\subsection{Detecting logic errors in use cases}
Should it be possible to jump ahead in the use case?


%TODO Integrate and finalize notes below.

% A use case returns a outputstate which is composed by an outputlog (log messages). A list of assumptions or an error. An error is for when an expectation failed, or a system error occured. Assumptions are for use case entries that are mapped to assumption statements.



%\section{Test framework}
% You need to write a test framework containing object pools, factory classes aso.
%\subsection{Exploiting injected semantics}
%How may we benefit from additional semantics? We can identify rubbish postconditions, such as predicates that involve objects that are either not modified in the statements, or simply never referenced.

%\section{Evaluating a use case}
%A use case can be modeled as a function taking in a starting environment and returning a boolean value, so $U \rightarrow env \rightarrow bool$


%Test case; when does it end? in our case, the message-sending archtecture is defined to be a work-queue where the dispatcher is decoupled from the message sending, which is merely an enqueuer. If the postcondition for our test case had been; "Message is received by contact", then the test-macro function becomes increasingly large.
%Test cases may further introduce dependencies, such as messageStore

%On the interface side, we decided that 2xx series HTTP codes where mapped to normal responses, and 4xx and 5xx to execeptions. 1xx and 3xx series are unused in our stak, and thus, unmapped. But it provides us with a good tool for -- on the client -- to explicitly state which replies should go where, and how they should be handled.

\section{Implementation}
