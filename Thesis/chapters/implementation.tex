\chapter{Implementation}
%TODO The capabilties (actions) were eventually dropped, as they provided little or no value.
%TODO Umet conditions (pre- and postconditions) should be handled by writing a code block that throws an error. Could simply be an expect.
Some basics on the procedure; take every line of the use case and not every concept and actor used. Then speculate on the realization of this. Which components should be involved, and which other actors. Depending on the concrete architecture, these components may be services, larger program components (such as Java packages), or even sub-functions.
%TODO Describe the normalize function.
%TODO Describe the technique as well. (The Mapping process).

\section{Template}
The templates are quite simple. They are source code files that have a single placeholder entry that is replaced with the generated code by the tool.

The placeholder is contained within a comment, so template files can still be parsed and complied before the generation step.


%TODO Overall generation concept. A test needs to be supplied with some resources as input.
%lead-in
The implementation is done in a client/server architecture. It consists of a three basic components; a client, a service and a shared library. These map to the folder structure. It is web based to allow easy collaboration.
%\section{Current implementation}
% tcc-tool is a client/server architecture with a share library.


%TODO add MVC to glossary.
Everything is built up as a layered model-view-control (MVC), that share a common library of models, utilities and interfaces.
%TODO what does the layer mean?

%identities of objects.
%Concept 2 remainders are left in the source three, and my be studied for reference.
%TODO The actions proved no actual value without the mapping language, and was removed from the implementation.

\subsection{Client}

\section{Example translation}

%TODO enter the use case.

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,style=usecase, caption=Use case example revisited, label=lst:uc-simple-example-revisited]
Scenario:
  Receptionist types in message
  Receptionist sends message
  Receptionist marks state as ready 
Preconditions:
  The receptionist is created
  The receptionist is logged in
Postconditions:
  The message is stored
  The receptionist is ready to handle the next call

\section{Testing}
% A use case returns a outputstate which is composed by an outputlog (log messages). A list of assumptions or an error. An error is for when an expectation failed, or a system error occured. Assumptions are for use case entries that are mapped to assumption statements.

\section{Protocol}
On the interface side, we decided that 2xx series HTTP codes where mapped to normal responses, and 4xx and 5xx to execeptions. 1xx and 3xx series are unused in our stak, and thus, unmapped. But it provides us with a good tool for -- on the client -- to explicitly state which replies should go where, and how they should be handled. A complete protocol specification is shown in appendix \ref{appendix:protocol}.


\section{Summary}
The implementation is on a prototype stage and contains some open ends.

The use case-as-precondtions could be implemented via a carried environment.. (explained somewhat in design).
