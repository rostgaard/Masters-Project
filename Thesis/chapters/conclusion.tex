\chapter{Conclusion}
The road to an (realistically) implementable product has been long and filled with dead-ends.
\section{Further work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Integrate into version control system
  \item Integrate into wiki system
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Interpretor-like use case steps}

\subsection{UI testing}
In the last few months use case-focused tests have been written for the OpenReception ReceptionistClient application using the Selenium project\footnote{http://www.seleniumhq.org/}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item A common programming language for tests and main code base matters.
\end{itemize}

%Continuous integration services are increasing in popularity -- and for a reason. It makes testing a more intricate part of the development, and the approach presented in this thesis takes it a whole new level.

In conclusion; the goal of having our tool users write use cases -- as close to use cases as possible, is not feasible in regards to automatic test generation without enforcing restrictions on use case writing. As this thesis focused in enforcing as little restrictions on use case writing as possible -- the solution proposed here is faulty by design, as it contradicts itself.
