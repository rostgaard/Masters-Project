%As requirements are basically constraints to your system, a subset of them may be expressed as expressions following a formality that is machine-interpretable. Vienna Development Method (VDM) and Z notation are two approaches that tries to formally describe systems on a very high level, so that model-checking can be performed on it prior to programming.
