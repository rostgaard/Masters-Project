\chapter{Conclusion}
The road to an (realistically) implementable product has been long and filled with dead-ends.
\section{Further work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Perform use case test from UI
  \item Integrate into version control system
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpretor-like use case steps}

\subsection{UI testing}
In the last few months use case-focused tests have been written for the OpenReception ReceptionistClient application using the Selenium project\footnote{http://www.seleniumhq.org/}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item A common programming language for tests and main code base matters.
\end{itemize}

Continuous integration services are increasing in popularity -- and for a reason. It makes testing a more intricate part of the development, and the approach presented in this thesis takes it a whole new level.
