\section{Further work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Perform use case test from UI
  \item Integrate into version control system
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{UI testing}
It is planned to expand the testing with use case playback from the user interface. A basic framework has been built using the Selenium project\footnote{http://www.seleniumhq.org/}.

%As requirements are basically constraints to your system, a subset of them may be expressed as expressions following a formality that is machine-interpretable. Vienna Development Method (VDM) and Z notation are two approaches that tries to formally describe systems on a very high level, so that model-checking can be performed on it prior to programming.

A common programming language for tests and main code base matters.
