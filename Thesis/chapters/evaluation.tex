\subsection{Side benefits}
%One of the major benefits is that it makes other black-box tests easier, as we can re-use components from the framework.

% Further work
%  - Misuse case
%  - Validating event chain against a state machine (automaton).
%  - Executable activity diagrams - knieke2010 
% Treating the system global state enforces a notion within the programmer how the specific activity acutally mutates the global state of the system.
