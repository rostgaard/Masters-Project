\chapter{Glossary}
\label{appendix:glossary}
This appendix contains a list of terms introduced or used in this thesis.
\begin{description}
  \item[Test support framework:] A hand-coded set of source code files that provides interfacing between the sources of application under development, and the tests files that are generated. In this thesis, it builds upon an existing test library designed for unit testing. It provides the needed ``setup'', ``teardown'', grouping and tests runners that catch and report unhandled exceptions.
  \item[CRUD:] Abbreviation of \textbf{C}reate, \textbf{R}ead \textbf{U}pdate and \textbf{D}elete is an acronym denoting the four primitives operation of persistent data storage. An interface for persistent storage may expose all or a subset of these primitives.
  \item[Requirement analysis:] Requirement analysis, for the purpose of this project, meant as a concept that uses some the information stored in the requirements to check it for validity, ambiguity and provide alternative representations. An example of an alternative representation is that a set of use cases becomes a use a use case diagram, just on a different abstraction level.

\chapter{Misfits}

\section{Event stack validation concept}
\label{sec:event-stack-validation}
A concept that was coined in parallel with the three concepts above -- which is not exclusively related to use cases -- but more validation in general, is the stack-replay concept. It is neither implemented, nor designed further than this concept.

\label{fig:event-stack-to-state-machine}
\end{figure}
%\section{Object tracking} NOTE: Maybe something about object lifecycles (and statemachines for them) here.
Example; in the use case it is stated that a call is hung up and a callee awaits this event. The lifeline of the call is however not tracked and to be able to properly assert the true state of this, the code macro needs to into account this lifeline and reflect on which assertions hold for every stakeholder that has knowledge of the call. % TODO: Elaborate the example and explain that a phone call is a good example because it has an A and B-leg and potentially a system that tracks its state.
