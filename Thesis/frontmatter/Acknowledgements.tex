\chapter{Acknowledgements}
The people that have endured the most, during the writing of this thesis, are probably my (soon-to-be) wife and kids, whom I owe a great deal of hugs and kisses for putting up with my non-presence.\\\\
Secondly, my supervisor Ekkart Kindler who have shown a degree of patience and ability to provide good feedback on my fuzzy notes, I've never seen the likes of.\\\\
Finally, Tom Desair\footnote{http://www.tomdesair.com} for making his \LaTeX use case available for the general public, and especially this author who has benefited greatly from them.
