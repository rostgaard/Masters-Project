\chapter{Acknowledgements}
The people that have endured the most, during the writing of this thesis, are probably my (soon-to-be) wife and kids, whom I owe a great deal of hugs and kisses for putting up with my non-presence.\medskip

\noindent Also, my supervisor Ekkart Kindler who have shown a degree of patience and ability to provide solid feedback on my confused writings, and kept me focused throughout the writing of this thesis.
