\chapter{Summary}
The world of software has over the years been tainted with stories about failed projects. Almost everyone has his or her own story about a software system, that did not solve the task, which it was designed to. This indicates either a mismatch between requirements and solution, or simply an erroneous requirement specification. In the recent decades more emphasis have been put on the agile methods, where smaller time-boxed iterations intricately contain every development phase: Design, implementation, documentation and validation. Requirement refinement and elicitation may, however, be left dead-in-the-water and remain a \emph{de facto} waterfall phase with neither feed-back from implementation and validation, nor feed-forward to validation.\bigskip

\noindent Adding enough structure, and/or formalism to enable automatic generation of artifacts -- such as documentation, diagrams and even tests -- from requirements is a careful balance. This balance is between strict rules for writing requirements, and usability. 
%TODO Cleanup and figure out a more exact summary.
The balance is also exactly what is sought by -- and is thus also the topic of -- this thesis.
