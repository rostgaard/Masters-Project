\chapter{Summary}
The world of software has over the years been tainted with stories about failed projects. Almost everyone has his or her own story about a software system, that did not solve the task, which it was designed to. This indicates either a mismatch between requirements and solution, or simply an erroneous requirement specification. In the recent decades more emphasis have been put on the agile methods, where smaller time-boxed iterations intricately contain every development phase: Design, implementation, documentation and validation. Requirement refinement and elicitation may, however, be left dead-in-the-water and remain a \emph{de facto} waterfall phase with neither feed-back from implementation and validation, nor feed-forward to validation.\bigskip

\noindent Adding enough structure, will automatic generation of artifacts such as documentation, diagrams and even tests from requirements. The questions are then, how much structure is needed, how much can be generated, and is it feasible?
