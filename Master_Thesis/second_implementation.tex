\section{Adding domain knowledge}
%STUB
If we were to add additional domain knowledge to the use cases, then we would also be able to extract capabilities easily.
%yada yada, use case example: actor does something to some other thing
% it means the the actor can do something to some other thing.

Taking one step up, trying to abstract away the current problem domain, what problem did we actually try to solve? We wanted to verify expected behavior of a system that we treat as being a black-box system. We use the holy grail of behavior -- the use cases -- as reference point to how the system should behave in difference situations.

%NOTE: use cases, and requirements must be expected to be incomplete (find some historical reference), and could possibly be thought into the development process,. making the use cases and requirement a more living part of the development.

%How to structure and formalize/represent requirements
